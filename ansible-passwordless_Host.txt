Ansible Password-less Connection to Multiple Host using Shell Script
==============================================

Pre-requisite
----------------------
 - Environment 
 	AWS (Amazon Web Services)
    (This section belongs to instances on AWS Environment)
   
Ansible Concept
---------------------
Master Server   =  Where ansible is installed
Host Server = Which is controlled by ansible master server,by seeing the host server entry in inventry file (hosts file)
                          Host may be any OS (e.g Amazon EC2,Ubuntu,RHEL,Fedora,CentOS)

Launch AWS EC2 Instances
---------------------------------
AMI : Amazon Ec2 linux 
Type: t2.micro
tag: Ans
No. of instances: 3
Securit Group: AnsibleSG
	ssh  22 
	http 80
Key: 
Launch

(3 instnces will be get launch out of which 1 would be master and 2 will be host)
 

Naming Ansible Instances
-----------------------------
1. AnsMaster
2. AnsNode1
3. Ans Node2

SSH to Ansible Instances
--------------------------------
1)  chmod 400 <Pem-keyName>
2)  ssh -i <Pem-keyName> ec2-user@<node-private ip> 

Concept of  passwordless connection from Master to Host
---------------------------------------------------------------
> When u create a ssh connection to your Node host from master with other user (ec2-user) except root user,
    your public key(.ssh/id_rsa.pub) from that user (ec2-user) from master will be appended/copied to your node user (ec2-user) 
     ssh folder authorized key(.ssh/authorized_keys).

> By using this concept we will create passwordless connection.

Steps for creating passwordless connection from Master to Host
===============================================
1)  SSH to All Instances using MobaxTerm Tool 
2) Tag one of them as Master and other two as Node1 and  Node2
3)  Go to Master and Install Ansible by using following command.

	sudo su
	yum update -y
	wget https://archive.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
	yum install epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm -y
	yum update -y
	yum install git python python-devel python-pip openssl ansible -y
	ansible --version

4)  Now you are root user in Master,check the .ssh folder and see authorized_keys contents

	ls .ssh/
	cat .ssh/authorized_keys

5)  Now Go to your Nodes and check ec2-user .ssh folder and  see authorized_keys contents

	ls .ssh/
	cat .ssh/authorized_keys

      -- Make backup copy of authorized keys

	sudo cp .ssh/authorized_keys .ssh/authorized_keys.bkp
	ls .ssh/

6) SSH Connection from master Node as root user	
   
  # become root user
    	sudo su -
  # create pem key file and copy pem key content from your host and save it and give it read permission

	1) vi <Pem-keyName>.pem
                              -- Paste pem key content
                      save & quit

	2) chmod 400 <Pem-keyName>.pem

	3) check pem key file permissions
	    ll <Pem-keyName>.pem

  # try to make ssh connection to Host

	ssh -i <Pem-keyName>.pem ec2-user@<node-private ip>

      (Connection is possible because all instances are using the same pem key)  
      (Exit from host by typing command "exit" and become root user in Master )

7)  SSH Connection from master Node as a ec2-user
  
   # Now u r root user , become ec2-user
   	exit
   # List out .ssh folder files of ec2-user and read authorized key content and make backup of your authorized key

	ls .ssh/
	cat .ssh/authorized_keys
	sudo cp .ssh/authorized_keys .ssh/authorized_keys.bkp

  # Copy <Pem-keyName>.pem file from root to ec2-user home directory

	sudo cp /root/<Pem-keyName>.pem  /home/ec2-user/
	
  # Change permission of <Pem-keyName>.pem

	sudo chown ec2-user:ec2-user <Pem-keyName>.pem
                  ll <Pem-keyName>.pem

  # Try to Make ssh connection to Nodes using ec2-user

	ssh -i <Pem-keyName>.pem ec2-user@<node-private ip>
                (Error because your ec2-user .ssh/rsa.pub conent is not appened or coppied to node ec2-user .ssh/authorized key)

   # To solve above problems type following command

	ssh-keygen  Enter
                  Enter
       (It will create 2 files in .ssh folder one private key as "id_rsa" and public key "id_rsa.pub")
	ls .ssh/

   # Copy the  id_rsa.pub file from Master to Host Node and  append it to Node ec2-user .ssh/authorized key as 

	sudo scp  -i <Pem-keyName>.pem /home/ec2-user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ec2-user@<node-private ip>:/home/ec2-user/
	sudo ssh -i <Pem-keyName>.pem ec2-user@<node-private ip> "cat  id_rsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys"

   # Now Try to Make ssh connection to Nodes using ec2-user

	ssh -i <Pem-keyName>.pem ec2-user@<node-private ip>
                                            OR
	ssh ec2-user@<node-private ip>
	 	        OR
	ssh <node-private ip>
                 (connection established.)
                 (Exit from Node by typing exit command)

8) Go to your Nodes and Now read content of ec2-user .ssh/authorized key file

                cat .ssh/authorized_keys

               (content of id_rsa.pub key from master is appended/copied to .ssh/authorized_keys)
               (thats why ssh connection is possible.)
